UD - Trainnig CNN's final year project to classify breast cancer images Problem Statement Can more people benefit from early cancer detection if a system capable of making such diagnoses is implemented? ðŸ¤”

There is a noticeable asymmetry in the education of doctors responsible for detecting breast cancer through images and the number of new cases over time in Colombia. This results in a disproportionate workload for these doctors, leading to some people not having access to this diagnosis and consequently missing out on the benefits of early detection, such as financial impact and better chances of a cure. ðŸ“‰

It is crucial to work on the diagnosis as it allows for the classification of individuals as healthy or sick, enabling different measures to be taken based on the stage of cancer. However, the rate at which expert doctors can be trained in classifying these individuals is much lower than the rate at which the population that needs to be evaluated is growing. ðŸ“ˆ

Project Description This project aims to develop a neural network classification system for diagnostic images of breast cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is implemented using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Bootstrap for the UI design. Python is used for AI-related image processing without the use of a specific AI library. ðŸš€

Goal The goal of this project is to create a system that can assist doctors in the classification of breast cancer diagnostic images, potentially allowing for more people to benefit from early cancer detection. This system aims to improve the speed and accuracy of classification, helping to address the current imbalance in access to early cancer diagnosis. ðŸŽ¯
